# Build a Simon Game

The [Build a Simon Game](https://feldbot.github.io/fcc-simon/) project is part of Free Code Camp's Legacy Front End Development certificate curriculum. Turn the game on and hit start to play in default mode, which will allow a player iteratively match the same sequence. A win consists of matching the pattern 9 times. Selecting strict mode will start a new random sequence if a player makes a mistake. This project demonstrates JavaScript programming proficiency and understanding sequencing of setTimeout methods.
